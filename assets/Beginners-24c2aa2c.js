BIOS：</strong><br> In order to enhance user experience or address identified bugs, we may release firmware updates. The BIOS pre-installed as the factory default can provide basic machine performance. Subsequently, we will introduce updated firmware versions based on user feedback to maximize machine efficiency. However, users should be aware that potential risks such as failure to power on due to firmware updates may require them to bear the cost of returning the product to the factory for re-flashing.</p><p><strong>2). Systems:</strong><br> This product is a hardware solution designed based on a universal architecture. It is compatible with mainstream X86 systems, including but not limited to Windows, Linux, Proxmox, VMware ESXi, pfSense, OPNsense, iKuai, OpenWrt, etc. Users are required to install the appropriate operating system based on their own needs, as no system or software is pre-installed at the factory. Additionally, our company does not provide any technical support for software or system-related issues that customers may encounter during usage.</p><p><strong>3). Cooling：<br></strong> This product features an active cooling system composed of an all-copper heat sink and a PWM temperature-controlled fan. The all-copper heat sink is in direct contact with the metal casing, serving as a passive auxiliary heat sink for overall heat dissipation. In hot weather or high ambient temperatures, the casing may attain some temperature. Please avoid prolonged contact with the casing to prevent potential low-temperature burns.</p><p><strong>4). Warranty：</strong><br> Due to the compact and highly integrated design of the machine, please refrain from disassembling the device on your own. All machines are affixed with anti-tamper labels. Once the anti-tamper label is removed, we regret to inform you that free warranty service cannot be provided. In the event of any operational malfunction during normal use, please contact our after-sales email (<a href="mailto:ikoolcore@gmail.com">ikoolcore@gmail.com</a>).
