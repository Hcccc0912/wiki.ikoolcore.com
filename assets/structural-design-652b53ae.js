Compared to the R1, the specific details of the optimization are mainly as follows:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Optimized heat dissipation openings</strong>: Added heat dissipation openings on the side with the network port, and widened the width of the heat sink openings.<br><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0696/1555/0751/files/Product_four-sided_view-Compressed.webp" style="zoom:30%;"></p></li><li><p><strong>Optimized heat dissipation treatment:</strong> The original copper tube + aluminum fin design has been optimized to a fully copper, CNC-machined, highly customized heat sink. The fan has also been upgraded to a super-quiet, double ball oil pressure bearing fan (3000 rpm) that supports PWM, four-wire PWM, 5V 0.05A power supply, and heat shrink tubing to protect the cable harness.<br></p><p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0696/1555/0751/files/Fan_Design-Compressed.webp" style="zoom:50%;"><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Optimized product nameplate:</strong> Added side openings, customized acrylic product nameplate, to increase product identification.<br></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0696/1555/0751/files/Nameplate_Specifications.webp" style="zoom:33%;"></li><li><p><strong>Added Wi-Fi module reserved interface:</strong> Meets the needs of some users with wireless network card requirements. The recommended network card is AX210NGW Wi-Fi 6E, and the antenna is recommended to use FPC patch antenna.</p></li></ul><p class="notice"><strong>Reminder:</strong> In OpenWrt system, basically no network card can be enabled as AP mode (i.e., to transmit Wi-Fi).</p><ul><li><strong>New cable retainers:</strong> Double retainers to secure cables, enhance the reliability of cables between the main and subboards, and also add retainers to secure cables on the lower core board to prevent potential physical failures such as no boot, no display, and network port not detected caused by cable reliability due to shaking or transportation during express delivery.</li><li><strong>Optimized intermediate fixed bracket design:</strong> The rubber ring installation method for fixing the top cover is more complete and reliable, and the hard drive slot opening design has also been optimized.</li><li><strong>Improved power button:</strong> Replaced acrylic power button with metal CNC power button, precisely designed button opening size and position, and reduced the shaking and malfunction of the power button (not completely avoided yet…).</li><li><strong>Optimized power light detail processing:</strong> Improve the power light leakage problem on R1, add black absorbing foam on the right and top of the USB, add a guide column to the power light, and correct the position of the power light hole.</li><li><strong>Standard metal top cover:</strong> Standard metal top cover, optimize the top design of the top cover, engrave the product model (R2) to increase brand recognition, continue to maintain the convex design of the hard drive cooler, all CNC technology, the top cover heat sink teeth have been rounded knife chamfered to prevent hand cuts.</li><li><strong>Optimized bottom cover design:</strong> Redesign the hole shape, and at the same time increase the thickness of the bottom plate to increase the structural strength and prevent the bottom plate from bending under pressure; at the same time, the VESA bracket hole adopts rivet technology (<em>eliminated tapping technology</em>), which is more flat.</li><li><strong>Optimized bottom foot pad design:</strong> The foot pad is a custom-made all-metal CNC, and a new anti-slip silicone foot pad is added to lift the height of the host while preventing slipping and shock absorption.</li><li><strong>Improved sandblasting process:</strong> From 120 mesh sandblasting to 150 mesh sandblasting, the appearance and feel are more delicate.</li></ul><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0696/1555/0751/files/Product_Structure_Diagram-Compressed.webp" style="zoom:50%;">',12),a=[r],u=[],f={__name:"structural-design",setup(d,{expose:e}){return e({frontmatter:{meta:[]}}),t({meta:[]}),(c,h)=>(s(),o("div",n,a))}};export{f as default,u as meta};
