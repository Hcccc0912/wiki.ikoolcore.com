Turn on the power and press <code>F12</code> to enter the UEFI boot option to select booting from the USB flash drive.</p></li><li><p>After booting, follow the steps below to flash BIOS:</p><pre><code>shellCopy code
# If a hard disk is connected, enter FS1:
fs0:
cd EFI\\boot\\
# Note: You can use Tab to autocomplete file names to avoid input errors.
.\\Fpt.efi -f .\\JP51CB_16G_SATA.bin
</code></pre></li><li><p>Precautions:</p><ul><li>Do not perform any operations or power off during the flashing process. When the <code>FPT Operation Successful</code> interface appears, the flashing program has been successful. Remove the USB flash drive and <strong>power off</strong> the machine to restart.</li><li><strong>PS:</strong> Flashing BIOS is risky, so please be cautious when performing the operation. In case of failure, please return to after-sales service.</li></ul></li></ol>`,3),n=[i],u=[],g={__name:"bios",setup(l,{expose:e}){return e({frontmatter:{meta:[]}}),o({meta:[]}),(h,p)=>(t(),s("div",a,n))}};export{g as default,u as meta};
